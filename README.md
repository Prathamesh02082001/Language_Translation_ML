# Language_Translation_ML

# Language Translation Project

## Overview

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Machine Learning to perform language translation. The goal is to translate text from one language to another using a pre-trained model.

## Features

- **Language Pairs:** Currently supports translation between [source language] and [target language].
- **Model Used:** [Specify the pre-trained NLP model used, e.g., Transformer, LSTM, etc.]
- **Accuracy:** The model achieves [mention the accuracy or performance metric] on the test dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [List any additional dependencies or libraries]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-translation.git
